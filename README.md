# Webinterface
Webinterface for PocketCloud,

## Requirements
> You need the `cURL` php extension
> Http service has to be enabled (`storage/config.json`)
> "web" has to be enabled too (`storage/config.json`)


## How to install it?
> You have to put the interface in the `/var/www/html/cloud/` directory or wherever you have your web pages located.
> After putting the webinterface in the folder, you have to edit the `config.json` in the `resources` folder.
> To create an account you have to use the `webaccount create <name>` command in the cloud console.
> After executing the command you will get a default password and after logging in into the interface you have to change it.

> **DISCLAIMER** The webinterface can only be run on the same server as the cloud itself!
